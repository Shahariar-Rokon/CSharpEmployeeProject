# CSharp Employee Age Calculation using Console

In this project, I've created a console application using C# that allows you to enter employee information, such as their name and date of birth. The application then calculates the employee's age based on the provided date of birth. The calculated age, along with the entered employee information, is then neatly printed in the console. This project serves as a simple demonstration of data input and processing in a C# console application.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Visual Studio.
- You have a Windows machine, as Visual Studio is not available on Linux or MacOS.
